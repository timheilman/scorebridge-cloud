So where we are at today is mostly in commit messages but...

with _no_ Condition:, the deploy succeeds w/event dest _enabled_.

However, test fails because I haven't verified my email address.

Now test failing for weird reasons, re-exported in cloud and then refreshed to webapp

OK, test weirdness fixed, now to put the damned security back in. But I hate stumbling in the dark.  How do I get to
see the request context?!??!
