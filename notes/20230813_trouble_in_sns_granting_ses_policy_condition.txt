So where we are at today is mostly in commit messages but...

with _no_ Condition:, the deploy succeeds w/event dest _enabled_.

However, test fails because I haven't verified my email address.

Now test failing for weird reasons, re-exported in cloud and then refreshed to webapp

OK, test weirdness fixed, now to put the damned security back in. But I hate stumbling in the dark.  How do I get to
see the request context?!??!

OK, can't get to see it, but with just the account restricted after the initial deploy, it's working.

Now restrict the arn too and see if it still works: I think I'm zeroing in on this being a serverless framework issue;
if this works I'll back off to just the two accounts restriction and see if it passes.  If so, discovering the arn
will be hard.  Can I do disjunction?
